Problem Statement Title - ERP-based Integrated Student Management System

Current Challenges (Existing System) - 

Admissions, fee collection, hostel allocation, and examination records are kept in separate ledgers.
Students are forced to stand in multiple queues for different processes (admissions, fees, hostel, library, exams).
Staff re-enter the same data in multiple departments, increasing errors and workload.
Administrators lack a real-time overview of the institution’s operations.
Comprehensive ERP systems exist, but they are too expensive for public colleges.

Why This Problem Matters - 

Inefficiency: Time wasted in queues, manual duplication of work.
Errors: Higher chances of mistakes due to multiple manual entries.
No Transparency: Management cannot make quick, data-driven decisions.
Affordability: Public institutions cannot afford costly ERP software.

Proposed Concept (Low-Cost ERP) - 

Instead of a heavy proprietary ERP:

Use widely available tools (Google Suite / Microsoft 365 / cloud-based apps).
Build an integrated workflow with forms, central spreadsheets, scripts, and dashboards.
Create a single source of truth (central database) accessible by all departments.
Automate repetitive tasks like fee receipts, hostel allocations, and backups.
Provide role-based access so each department sees only what’s relevant.

Essential Components of the Solution

Admission Intake
Online forms feed directly into the central student database.

2. Automated Fee Collection
Payment gateways linked with auto-generated receipts.
Transactions update student records instantly.

3. Hostel & Library Tracking
Real-time hostel occupancy dashboard.
Library issue/return logs synced with the student profile.

4. Examination Records
Marks, attendance, and grades integrated into the same database.

5. Summary Dashboards
Real-time reports for higher officials: admissions, revenue, hostel, and academic data.

6. Data Security & Backups
Role-based access, encrypted storage, and regular automated backups.

Expected Outcome - 

A low-cost ERP system built on familiar tools and lightweight scripting.
Staff adoption is easier since they already know spreadsheets and forms.
Seamless workflow: Admission → Database → Fees → Hostel/Library → Exams → Dashboards.
A replicable model that any public college can implement without major investment.

Hackathon Deliverables (Expected from Participants) - 

Integrated workflow demo showing end-to-end data flow.
Automation of key processes like receipt generation and hostel allocation.
Role-based dashboards for different stakeholders.
Documentation of process mapping (how apps are linked together).
Security & backup mechanisms built-in from the start.
